## 🔍 Problem Statement

Modern e-commerce platforms generate massive amounts of transaction data every day. Businesses often struggle to understand customer purchasing behavior and recommend relevant products effectively.

Traditional marketing approaches treat all customers similarly, leading to reduced engagement and lower conversion rates.

This project aims to answer:

**How can customer transaction data be used to segment customers and provide personalized product recommendations?**

The project uses the Online Retail Dataset containing transactions from a UK-based online retail store.

### Features

| Column      | Description         |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| InvoiceNo   | Invoice Number      |
| StockCode   | Product Code        |
| Description | Product Name        |
| Quantity    | Quantity Purchased  |
| InvoiceDate | Purchase Date       |
| UnitPrice   | Product Price       |
| CustomerID  | Customer Identifier |
| Country     | Customer Country    |

### Dataset Statistics

* Original Records: 541,909+
* Records After Cleaning: 392,000+
* Unique Customers: 4,338
* Unique Products: 3,877
* Countries Covered: 30+

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

* Removed duplicate transactions
* Removed missing Customer IDs
* Excluded cancelled invoices
* Removed invalid quantities and prices
* Converted InvoiceDate to datetime format
* Created TotalPrice feature

### Total Revenue Formula

```python
df["TotalPrice"] = df["Quantity"] * df["UnitPrice"]
```

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

Several business insights were extracted:

### Country Analysis

* United Kingdom dominates total transactions.
* European countries contribute significantly to sales volume.

### Product Analysis

---

## 💰 RFM Analysis

Customer behavior was analyzed using:

### Recency (R)

Number of days since customer's last purchase.

### Frequency (F)

Number of transactions made by the customer.

### Monetary (M)

Total amount spent by the customer.

### Example

| Customer | Recency | Frequency | Monetary |
| -------- | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| A        | 10      | 250       | 6000     |
| B        | 180     | 5         | 300      |

## 🤖 Customer Segmentation

### Clustering Algorithm

K-Means Clustering

### Feature Processing

* Log Transformation
* StandardScaler Normalization
* Elbow Method
* Silhouette Score Analysis

### Optimal Clusters

K = 4

### Customer Segments

| Segment    | Characteristics                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| High-Value | Recent, frequent, high spenders |
| Regular    | Consistent customers            |
| Occasional | Moderate purchasing behavior    |
| At-Risk    | Inactive customers              |
